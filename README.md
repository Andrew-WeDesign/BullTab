This project was designed to be an interesting way to communicate stock picks based on technical analysis. The github projects BullBot, BullHorn, and BullTab are all 3 parts of a single idea.

Future plans: Plan to create 3 seperate projects as they currently exist but to seperate into the following 3 segments: 1) Discord Bot, 2) Web API, and 3) the program to gather data, scrape information, and complete technical analysis on this data to store in the database to then be callable by the Web API.
